This files contains our POSITION ESTIMATION STUDY FOR A MOBILE ROBOT (with STM32 - MPU6050 - OLED SCREEN - STEP MOTOR) at ESOGÃœ in 2018

I suggest you review the project thesis and poster for a better understanding. (Project poster written in Turkish)

Each file contains lastest versions of our studies.

I will add the necessary circuit diagrams as soon as possible.(until then you can access some of the connetions in the CubeMX file in the keil file)
